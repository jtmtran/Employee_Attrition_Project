## Introduction
<br>This project investigates the factors driving employee attrition within various departments at a fictional company. The goal is to identify key drivers, such as job satisfaction, income, work-life balance, and performance, and propose actionable recommendations for improving employee retention.

## Analysis of Factors
<br>**1. High Attrition in Human Resources with Low Job Satisfaction**
<br>•	Attrition rate in HR is 45.45% for employees with job satisfaction = 1, despite reasonable income levels.
<br>•	High turnover suggests that dissatisfaction in HR is driven by factors beyond salary, such as workplace environment or lack of engagement.

<br>**2. Sales Department: High Income, Yet High Attrition**
<br>•	Sales employees with job satisfaction = 1 have a 26.74% attrition rate, even with the highest average income of $6,993.
<br>•	Elevated attrition across multiple satisfaction levels points to workload stress and performance pressure as possible contributors.

<br>**3. Research & Development (R&D): Strong Link Between Satisfaction and Retention**
<br>•	R&D exhibits lower attrition rates, with attrition decreasing steadily as job satisfaction improves (from 19.79% at satisfaction = 1 to 9.49% at satisfaction = 4).
<br>•	Conclusion: Job satisfaction plays a crucial role in retention in R&D.

<br>**4. Work-Life Balance and Overtime Impact on Sales and HR**
<br>•	In Sales, poor work-life balance (rated 1) leads to an attrition rate of 37.5%.
<br>•	For HR, attrition decreases from 28.57% (work-life balance = 2) to 10% (work-life balance = 4).
<br>•	Conclusion: Improving work-life balance can be an effective retention strategy in both departments.

<br>**5. Performance Rating: Higher Performers More Likely to Stay**
<br>•	Sales employees with performance rating = 4 have an attrition rate of 16.39%, lower than those with a rating of 3 (21.30%).
<br>•	Conclusion: Engaged and high-performing employees exhibit lower turnover, indicating that investing in career growth can improve retention.

## Key Insights
<br>**Income vs. Attrition**
<br>•	Employees who left the company earned an average of $4,787, significantly lower than those who stayed ($6,832).
<br>•	Conclusion: Higher income contributes to retention, but it’s not the sole factor. Addressing non-monetary factors such as work-life balance and stress is essential.

<br>**Training and Development**
<br>•	Employees who received 5-6 training sessions per year showed lower attrition rates (as low as 4.26%).
<br>•	Those with no training had the highest attrition rate of 21.05%.
<br>•	Conclusion: Regular training contributes to employee retention by fostering growth and engagement.

<br>**Years at Company and Attrition**
<br>•	The highest attrition occurs in the first few years of employment, indicating potential onboarding or engagement challenges.
<br>•	Conclusion: Focusing on early retention strategies and enhancing the employee experience during the first year can reduce turnover.

## Conclusion
<br>By focusing on improving job satisfaction, work-life balance, and career development opportunities, companies can significantly reduce attrition. Implementing regular training and aligning employee development with long-term career goals will lead to higher retention rates and a more engaged workforce.
